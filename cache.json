While successors like QwQ,\nDeepseek-R1 (R1) and LIMO replicate these advancements, whether these models\ntruly possess test-time scaling capabilities remains underexplored. This study\nfound that longer CoTs of these o1-like models do not consistently enhance\naccuracy; in fact, correct solutions are often shorter than incorrect ones for\nthe same questions. Further investigation shows this phenomenon is closely\nrelated to models' self-revision capabilities - longer CoTs contain more\nself-revisions, which often lead to performance degradation. We then compare\nsequential and parallel scaling strategies on QwQ, R1 and LIMO, finding that\nparallel scaling achieves better coverage and scalability. Based on these\ninsights, we propose Shortest Majority Vote, a method that combines parallel\nscaling strategies with CoT length characteristics, significantly improving\nmodels' test-time scalability compared to conventional majority voting\napproaches.\n","authors":["Zhiyuan Zeng","Qinyuan Cheng","Zhangyue Yin","Yunhua Zhou","Xipeng Qiu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12215v2.pdf","comment":"Add the github link"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19723v2","updated":"2025-03-03T15:07:28Z","published":"2025-02-27T03:25:34Z","title":"CNsum:Automatic Summarization for Chinese News Text","summary":"  Obtaining valuable information from massive data efficiently has become our\nresearch goal in the era of Big Data.

Building on this idea, we introduce\nSurvival Game as a framework to evaluate intelligence based on the number of\nfailed attempts in a trial-and-error process. Fewer failures indicate higher\nintelligence. When the expectation and variance of failure counts are both\nfinite, it signals the ability to consistently find solutions to new\nchallenges, which we define as the Autonomous Level of intelligence. Using\nSurvival Game, we comprehensively evaluate existing AI systems. Our results\nshow that while AI systems achieve the Autonomous Level in simple tasks, they\nare still far from it in more complex tasks, such as vision, search,\nrecommendation, and language. While scaling current AI technologies might help,\nthis would come at an astronomical cost. Projections suggest that achieving the\nAutonomous Level for general tasks would require $10^{26}$ parameters. To put\nthis into perspective, loading such a massive model requires so many H100 GPUs\nthat their total value is $10^{7}$ times that of Apple Inc.'s market value.\nEven with Moore's Law, supporting such a parameter scale would take $70$ years.\nThis staggering cost highlights the complexity of human tasks and the\ninadequacies of current AI technologies. To further investigate this\nphenomenon, we conduct a theoretical analysis of Survival Game and its\nexperimental results. Our findings suggest that human tasks possess a\ncriticality property. As a result, Autonomous Level requires a deep\nunderstanding of the task's underlying mechanisms.

The algorithm works as follows: at inference time,\nN samples are drawn from the language model, and the sample with the highest\nreward, as judged by a reward model, is returned as the output. Despite its\neffectiveness, BoN is computationally expensive; it reduces sampling throughput\nby a factor of N. To make BoN more efficient at inference time, one strategy is\nto fine-tune the language model to mimic what BoN does during inference. To\nachieve this, we derive the distribution induced by the BoN algorithm. We then\npropose to fine-tune the language model to minimize backward KL divergence to\nthe BoN distribution. Our approach is analogous to mean-field variational\ninference and, thus, we term it variational BoN (vBoN). To the extent this\nfine-tuning is successful and we end up with a good approximation, we have\nreduced the inference cost by a factor of N. Our experiments on controlled\ngeneration and summarization tasks show that BoN is the most effective\nalignment method, and our variational approximation to BoN achieves the closest\nperformance to BoN and surpasses models fine-tuned using the standard\nKL-constrained RL objective.

Extensive experiments\nhave been performed on the NISQA, BVCC, SOMOS and VoxSim speech quality\ndatasets, using open-source auditory LLMs such as SALMONN, Qwen-Audio, and\nQwen2-Audio. For the natural language descriptions task, a commercial model\nGoogle Gemini 1.5 Pro is also evaluated. The results demonstrate that auditory\nLLMs achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art task-specific\nsmall models in predicting MOS and SIM, while also delivering promising results\nin A/B testing and natural language descriptions.

Each dilemma\npresents two possible actions, along with affected parties and relevant human\nvalues for each action. Based on these dilemmas, we gather a repository of\nhuman values covering diverse everyday topics, such as interpersonal\nrelationships, workplace, and environmental issues. With DailyDilemmas, we\nevaluate LLMs on these dilemmas to determine what action they will choose and\nthe values represented by these action choices. Then, we analyze values through\nthe lens of five theoretical frameworks inspired by sociology, psychology, and\nphilosophy, including the World Values Survey, Moral Foundations Theory,\nMaslow's Hierarchy of Needs, Aristotle's Virtues, and Plutchik's Wheel of\nEmotions. For instance, we find LLMs are most aligned with self-expression over\nsurvival in World Values Survey and care over loyalty in Moral Foundations\nTheory.

Current memory systems enable basic storage and\nretrieval but lack sophisticated memory organization, despite recent attempts\nto incorporate graph databases. Moreover, these systems' fixed operations and\nstructures limit their adaptability across diverse tasks. To address this\nlimitation, this paper proposes a novel agentic memory system for LLM agents\nthat can dynamically organize memories in an agentic way. Following the basic\nprinciples of the Zettelkasten method, we designed our memory system to create\ninterconnected knowledge networks through dynamic indexing and linking. When a\nnew memory is added, we generate a comprehensive note containing multiple\nstructured attributes, including contextual descriptions, keywords, and tags.\nThe system then analyzes historical memories to identify relevant connections,\nestablishing links where meaningful similarities exist.

Traditional machine learning models often fail to fully capture the\narray of expressed topics. However, Large Language Models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated remarkable effectiveness across numerous Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) tasks in various domains, which show impressive computational\nefficiency and suitability for unsupervised learning through prompt\nengineering. Consequently, these LLMs promise an effective MLTC of medical\nnarratives. However, when dealing with various labels, different prompts can be\nrelevant depending on the topic. To address these challenges, the proposed\napproach, QUAD-LLM-MLTC, leverages the strengths of four LLMs: GPT-4o, BERT,\nPEGASUS, and BART. QUAD-LLM-MLTC operates in a sequential pipeline in which\nBERT extracts key tokens, PEGASUS augments textual data, GPT-4o classifies, and\nBART provides topics' assignment probabilities, which results in four\nclassifications, all in a 0-shot setting. The outputs are then combined using\nensemble learning and processed through a meta-classifier to produce the final\nMLTC result. The approach is evaluated using three samples of annotated texts,\nwhich contrast it with traditional and single-model methods. The results show\nsignificant improvements across the majority of the topics in the\nclassification's F1 score and consistency (F1 and Micro-F1 scores of 78.17% and\n80.16% with standard deviations of 0.025 and 0.011, respectively).

Recent\nprogress in Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) has opened up new\npossibilities for interactive diagnostic tools. However, these models often\nsuffer from factual hallucination, which can lead to incorrect diagnoses.\nFine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have emerged as methods to\naddress these issues.

Choosing how sensitive the model is to\nits context is a fundamental functionality, as it enables the model to excel at\ntasks like retrieval-augmented generation and question-answering. In this\npaper, we search for a knob which controls this sensitivity, determining\nwhether language models answer from the context or their prior knowledge. To\nguide this search, we design a task for controllable context sensitivity. In\nthis task, we first feed the model a context (Paris is in England) and a\nquestion (Where is Paris?); we then instruct the model to either use its prior\nor contextual knowledge and evaluate whether it generates the correct answer\nfor both intents (either France or England). When fine-tuned on this task,\ninstruction-tuned versions of Llama-3.1, Mistral-v0.3, and Gemma-2 can solve it\nwith high accuracy (85-95%). Analyzing these high-performing models, we narrow\ndown which layers may be important to context sensitivity using a novel linear\ntime algorithm. Then, in each model, we identify a 1-D subspace in a single\nlayer that encodes whether the model follows context or prior knowledge.\nInterestingly, while we identify this subspace in a fine-tuned model, we find\nthat the exact same subspace serves as an effective knob in not only that model\nbut also non-fine-tuned instruct and base models of that model family. Finally,\nwe show a strong correlation between a model's performance and how distinctly\nit separates context-agreeing from context-ignoring answers in this subspace.\nThese results suggest a single subspace facilitates how the model chooses\nbetween context and prior knowledge, hinting at a simple fundamental mechanism\nthat controls this behavior.\n","authors":["Julian Minder","Kevin Du","Niklas Stoehr","Giovanni Monea","Chris Wendler","Robert West","Ryan Cotterell"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07404v2.pdf","comment":"Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20854v2","updated":"2025-03-03T03:00:59Z","published":"2025-02-28T08:53:08Z","title":"A Pilot Empirical Study on When and How to Use Knowledge Graphs as\n  Retrieval Augmented Generation","summary":"  The integration of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) into the Retrieval Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) framework has attracted significant interest, with early\nstudies showing promise in mitigating hallucinations and improving model\naccuracy.

Previous work has primarily\nrelied on techniques such as representation surgery -- e.g., model ablations or\nmanipulation of linear subspaces tied to specific concepts -- to\n\\emph{intervene} on these models. To understand the impact of interventions\nprecisely, it is useful to examine \\emph{counterfactuals} -- e.g., how a given\nsentence would have appeared had it been generated by the model following a\nspecific intervention. We highlight that counterfactual reasoning is\nconceptually distinct from interventions, as articulated in Pearl's causal\nhierarchy. Based on this observation, we propose a framework for generating\ntrue string counterfactuals by reformulating language models as a structural\nequation model using the Gumbel-max trick, which we called Gumbel\ncounterfactual generation. This reformulation allows us to model the joint\ndistribution over original strings and their counterfactuals resulting from the\nsame instantiation of the sampling noise. We develop an algorithm based on\nhindsight Gumbel sampling that allows us to infer the latent noise variables\nand generate counterfactuals of observed strings.

We show that LLMs possess linear representations of political\nperspectives within activation space, wherein more similar perspectives are\nrepresented closer together. To do so, we probe the attention heads across the\nlayers of three open transformer-based LLMs (\\texttt{Llama-2-7b-chat},\n\\texttt{Mistral-7b-instruct}, \\texttt{Vicuna-7b}). We first prompt models to\ngenerate text from the perspectives of different U.S.~lawmakers. We then\nidentify sets of attention heads whose activations linearly predict those\nlawmakers' DW-NOMINATE scores, a widely-used and validated measure of political\nideology. We find that highly predictive heads are primarily located in the\nmiddle layers, often speculated to encode high-level concepts and tasks. Using\nprobes only trained to predict lawmakers' ideology, we then show that the same\nprobes can predict measures of news outlets' slant from the activations of\nmodels prompted to simulate text from those news outlets.

Previous approaches compress vision tokens with external\nmodules and force LLMs to understand the compressed ones, leading to visual\ninformation loss. However, the LLMs' understanding paradigm of vision tokens is\nnot fully utilised in the compression learning process.

The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting has\nboosted it to the next level by showing real-time rendering potentials. An\nintuitive finding is that the models used for inverse rendering do not take\ninto account the dependency of opacity w.r.t. material properties, namely cross\nsection, as suggested by optics.

Information on how different workshops were managed and\nthe processes by which artworks were created remains elusive. Machine learning\nmethods have potential to unearth new information about artists' creative\nprocesses by extending the analysis of brushwork to a microscopic scale.\nAnalysis of workshop paintings, however, presents a challenge in that\ndocumentation of the artists and materials involved is sparse, meaning external\nexamples are not available to train networks to recognize their contributions.\nHere we present a novel machine learning approach we call pairwise assignment\ntraining for classifying heterogeneity (PATCH) that is capable of identifying\nindividual artistic practice regimes with no external training data, or \"ground\ntruth.\" The method achieves unsupervised results by supervised means, and\noutperforms both simple statistical procedures and unsupervised machine\nlearning methods. We apply this method to two historical paintings by the\nSpanish Renaissance master, El Greco: The Baptism of Christ and Christ on the\nCross with Landscape, and our findings regarding the former potentially\nchallenge previous work that has assigned the painting to workshop members.\nFurther, the results of our analyses create a measure of heterogeneity of\nartistic practice that can be used to characterize artworks across time and\nspace.\n","authors":["Andrew Van Horn","Lauryn Smith","Mahamad Mahmoud","Michael McMaster","Clara Pinchbeck","Ina Martin","Andrew Lininger","Anthony Ingrisano","Adam Lowe","Carlos Bayod","Elizabeth Bolman","Kenneth Singer","Michael Hinczewski"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01912v2.pdf","comment":"main text: 16 pages, 6 figures; SI: 7 pages, 3 figures; v2: minor\n  typo corrections, higher resolution figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02112v5","updated":"2025-03-03T04:42:15Z","published":"2024-02-03T10:35:42Z","title":"S-NeRF++: Autonomous Driving Simulation via Neural Reconstruction and\n  Generation","summary":"  Autonomous driving simulation system plays a crucial role in enhancing\nself-driving data and simulating complex and rare traffic scenarios, ensuring\nnavigation safety.

Investigating the adversarial robustness of embodied vision\nnavigation is crucial, especially given the threat of 3D physical attacks that\ncould pose risks to human safety. However, existing attack methods for embodied\nvision navigation often lack physical feasibility due to challenges in\ntransferring digital perturbations into the physical world. Moreover, current\nphysical attacks for object detection struggle to achieve both multi-view\neffectiveness and visual naturalness in navigation scenarios. To address this,\nwe propose a practical attack method for embodied navigation by attaching\nadversarial patches to objects, where both opacity and textures are learnable.\nSpecifically, to ensure effectiveness across varying viewpoints, we employ a\nmulti-view optimization strategy based on object-aware sampling, which\noptimizes the patch's texture based on feedback from the vision-based\nperception model used in navigation. To make the patch inconspicuous to human\nobservers, we introduce a two-stage opacity optimization mechanism, in which\nopacity is fine-tuned after texture optimization. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our adversarial patches decrease the navigation success rate\nby an average of 22.39%, outperforming previous methods in practicality,\neffectiveness, and naturalness.

This model is\ntrained to segment the corpus into semantically complete chunks. Second, to\nensure that only the most relevant chunks are retrieved while the irrelevant\nones are ignored, we design a chunk selection algorithm to dynamically select\nchunks based on the decreasing speed of the relevance score, leading to a more\nrelevant selection.

A key obstacle is the\ninherent complexity of ECG data, which includes heterogeneity (e.g., varying\nsampling rates), high levels of noise, demographic-related pattern shifts, and\nintricate rhythm-event associations. To overcome these challenges, this paper\nintroduces AnyECG, a foundational model designed to extract robust\nrepresentations from any real-world ECG data. Specifically, a tailored ECG\nTokenizer encodes each fixed-duration ECG fragment into a token and, guided by\nproxy tasks, converts noisy, continuous ECG features into discrete, compact,\nand clinically meaningful local rhythm codes. These codes encapsulate basic\nmorphological, frequency, and demographic information (e.g., sex), effectively\nmitigating signal noise.

A common approach in offline MBO is to\ntrain a regression-based surrogate model by minimizing mean squared error (MSE)\nand then find the best design within this surrogate model by different\noptimizers (e.g., gradient ascent). However, a critical challenge is the risk\nof out-of-distribution errors, i.e., the surrogate model may typically\noverestimate the scores and mislead the optimizers into suboptimal regions.\nPrior works have attempted to address this issue in various ways, such as using\nregularization techniques and ensemble learning to enhance the robustness of\nthe model, but it still remains. In this paper, we argue that regression models\ntrained with MSE are not well-aligned with the primary goal of offline MBO,\nwhich is to select promising designs rather than to predict their scores\nprecisely. Notably, if a surrogate model can maintain the order of candidate\ndesigns based on their relative score relationships, it can produce the best\ndesigns even without precise predictions. To validate it, we conduct\nexperiments to compare the relationship between the quality of the final\ndesigns and MSE, finding that the correlation is really very weak.

Thus, the demands\nfor customizing publicly available LLMs emerge, but are currently\nunder-studied. In this work, we consider customizing pre-trained LLMs with new\nhuman preferences. Specifically, the LLM should not only meet the new\npreference but also preserve its original capabilities after customization.\nDrawing inspiration from the observation that human preference can be expressed\nas a reward model, we propose to cast LLM customization as optimizing the sum\nof two reward functions, one of which (denoted as $r_1$) was used to pre-train\nthe LLM while the other (denoted as $r_2$) characterizes the new human\npreference. The obstacle here is that both reward functions are unknown, making\nthe application of modern reinforcement learning methods infeasible. Thanks to\nthe residual Q-learning framework, we can restore the customized LLM with the\npre-trained LLM and the \\emph{residual Q-function} without the reward function\n$r_1$.

Weight-only quantization can be a promising\napproach, but sub-4 bit quantization remains a challenge due to large-magnitude\nactivation outliers. To mitigate the undesirable outlier effect, we first\npropose per-IC quantization, a simple yet effective method that creates\nquantization groups within each input channel (IC) rather than the conventional\nper-output-channel (per-OC).

Formulating and\nthen solving optimization problems described by natural language often requires\nhighly specialized human expertise, which could block the widespread\napplication of optimization-based decision making. To automate problem\nformulation and solving, leveraging large language models (LLMs) has emerged as\na potential way. However, this kind of approach suffers from the issue of\noptimization generalization. Namely, the accuracy of most current LLM-based\nmethods and the generality of optimization problem types that they can model\nare still limited. In this paper, we propose a unified learning-based framework\ncalled LLMOPT to boost optimization generalization. Starting from the natural\nlanguage descriptions of optimization problems and a pre-trained LLM, LLMOPT\nconstructs the introduced five-element formulation as a universal model for\nlearning to define diverse optimization problem types. Then, LLMOPT employs the\nmulti-instruction tuning to enhance both problem formalization and solver code\ngeneration accuracy and generality.

However, such methods lack theoretical guarantees, making\nthem prone to unexpected failures. Conversely, principled CL approaches often\nfail to achieve competitive performance. In this work, we aim to bridge this\ngap between theory and practice by designing a simple CL method that is\ntheoretically sound and highly performant. Specifically, we lift pre-trained\nfeatures into a higher dimensional space and formulate an over-parametrized\nminimum-norm least-squares problem. We find that the lifted features are highly\nill-conditioned, potentially leading to large training errors (numerical\ninstability) and increased generalization errors. We address these challenges\nby continually truncating the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the lifted\nfeatures. Our approach, termed TSVD, is stable with respect to the choice of\nhyperparameters, can handle hundreds of tasks, and outperforms state-of-the-art\nCL methods on multiple datasets. Importantly, our method satisfies a recurrence\nrelation throughout its continual learning process, which allows us to prove it\nmaintains small training and generalization errors by appropriately truncating\na fraction of SVD factors.

Machine unlearning has emerged as a representative approach for model\nsafety and security by removing the influence of undesired data on the target\nmodel. However, these methods do not sufficiently consider that unlearning\nrequests in real-world scenarios are continuously emerging, especially in the\ncontext of LLMs, which may lead to accumulated model utility loss that\neventually becomes unacceptable. Moreover, existing LLM unlearning methods\noften ignore previous data access limitations due to privacy concerns and\ncopyright protection. Without previous data, the utility preservation during\nunlearning is much harder. To overcome these challenges, we propose the OOO\nframework that includes an Orthogonal low-rank adapter (LoRA) for continually\nunlearning requested data and an Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detector to measure\nthe similarity between input and unlearning data. The orthogonal LoRA achieves\nparameter disentanglement among continual unlearning requests. The OOD detector\nis trained with a novel contrastive entropy loss and utilizes a glocal-aware\nscoring mechanism. During inference, our OOO framework can decide whether and\nto what extent to load the unlearning LoRA based on the OOD detector's\npredicted similarity between the input and the unlearned knowledge. Notably,\nOOO's effectiveness does not rely on any retained data. We conducted extensive\nexperiments on OOO and state-of-the-art LLM unlearning methods across three\ntasks and seven datasets. The results indicate that OOO consistently achieves\nthe best unlearning effectiveness and utility preservation, especially when\nfacing continuous unlearning requests.

Previous work has primarily\nrelied on techniques such as representation surgery -- e.g., model ablations or\nmanipulation of linear subspaces tied to specific concepts -- to\n\\emph{intervene} on these models. To understand the impact of interventions\nprecisely, it is useful to examine \\emph{counterfactuals} -- e.g., how a given\nsentence would have appeared had it been generated by the model following a\nspecific intervention. We highlight that counterfactual reasoning is\nconceptually distinct from interventions, as articulated in Pearl's causal\nhierarchy. Based on this observation, we propose a framework for generating\ntrue string counterfactuals by reformulating language models as a structural\nequation model using the Gumbel-max trick, which we called Gumbel\ncounterfactual generation. This reformulation allows us to model the joint\ndistribution over original strings and their counterfactuals resulting from the\nsame instantiation of the sampling noise. We develop an algorithm based on\nhindsight Gumbel sampling that allows us to infer the latent noise variables\nand generate counterfactuals of observed strings.

For instance, based on the recent behavior of an autonomous car, a\nnearby human driver might predict that the car is going to remain in the same\nlane. It is important for the robot to understand the human's prediction for\nsafe and seamless interaction: e.g., if the autonomous car knows the human\nthinks it is not merging -- but the autonomous car actually intends to merge --\nthen the car can adjust its behavior to prevent an accident. Prior works\ntypically assume that humans make precise predictions of robot behavior.\nHowever, recent research on human-human prediction suggests the opposite:\nhumans tend to approximate other agents by predicting their high-level\nbehaviors. We apply this finding to develop a second-order theory of mind\napproach that enables robots to estimate how humans predict they will behave.\nTo extract these high-level predictions directly from data, we embed the recent\nhuman and robot trajectories into a discrete latent space. Each element of this\nlatent space captures a different type of behavior (e.g., merging in front of\nthe human, remaining in the same lane) and decodes into a vector field across\nthe state space that is consistent with the underlying behavior type. We\nhypothesize that our resulting high-level and course predictions of robot\nbehavior will correspond to actual human predictions.

These strategies provide additional flexibility to scale\ntest-time computation (e.g., by increasing retrieved documents or generation\nsteps), thereby enhancing LLMs' ability to effectively acquire and utilize\ncontextual information. We address two key questions: (1) How does RAG\nperformance benefit from the scaling of inference computation when optimally\nconfigured? (2) Can we predict the optimal test-time compute allocation for a\ngiven budget by modeling the relationship between RAG performance and inference\nparameters? Our observations reveal that increasing inference computation leads\nto nearly linear gains in RAG performance when optimally allocated, a\nrelationship we describe as the inference scaling laws for RAG. Building on\nthis, we further develop the computation allocation model to estimate RAG\nperformance across different inference configurations.

In this paper, we introduce LLaVA-Mini, an efficient LMM with minimal\nvision tokens. To achieve a high compression ratio of vision tokens while\npreserving visual information, we first analyze how LMMs understand vision\ntokens and find that most vision tokens only play a crucial role in the early\nlayers of LLM backbone, where they mainly fuse visual information into text\ntokens. Building on this finding, LLaVA-Mini introduces modality pre-fusion to\nfuse visual information into text tokens in advance, thereby facilitating the\nextreme compression of vision tokens fed to LLM backbone into one token.\nLLaVA-Mini is a unified large multimodal model that can support the\nunderstanding of images, high-resolution images, and videos in an efficient\nmanner. Experiments across 11 image-based and 7 video-based benchmarks\ndemonstrate that LLaVA-Mini outperforms LLaVA-v1.5 with just 1 vision token\ninstead of 576.

Textual\nreasoning has inherent limitations in solving tasks with challenges in math,\nlogics, optimization, and searching, which is unlikely to be solved by simply\nscaling up the model and data size. The recently released OpenAI GPT Code\nInterpreter and multi-agent frameworks such as AutoGen have demonstrated\nremarkable proficiency of integrating code generation and execution to solve\ncomplex tasks using LLMs. However, based on our experiments on 7 existing\npopular methods for steering code/text generation in both single- and\nmulti-turn settings with 14 tasks and 6 types of LLMs (including the new\nO1-preview), currently there is no optimal method to correctly steer LLMs to\nwrite code when needed.

This\nphenomenon has been widely adopted in applications such as streaming/long\ncontext generation, KV cache optimization, inference acceleration, model\nquantization, and others. Despite its widespread use, a deep understanding of\nattention sink in LMs is still lacking. In this work, we first demonstrate that\nattention sinks exist universally in LMs with various inputs, even in small\nmodels. Furthermore, attention sink is observed to emerge during the LM\npre-training, motivating us to investigate how optimization, data distribution,\nloss function, and model architecture in LM pre-training influence its\nemergence. We highlight that attention sink emerges after effective\noptimization on sufficient training data. The sink position is highly\ncorrelated with the loss function and data distribution. Most importantly, we\nfind that attention sink acts more like key biases, storing extra attention\nscores, which could be non-informative and not contribute to the value\ncomputation. We also observe that this phenomenon (at least partially) stems\nfrom tokens' inner dependence on attention scores as a result of softmax\nnormalization. After relaxing such dependence by replacing softmax attention\nwith other attention operations, such as sigmoid attention without\nnormalization, attention sinks do not emerge in LMs up to 1B parameters.

We find that PPL overlooks key\ntokens, which are essential for long-context understanding, by averaging across\nall tokens and thereby obscuring the true performance of models in long-context\nscenarios. To address this, we propose \\textbf{LongPPL}, a novel metric that\nfocuses on key tokens by employing a long-short context contrastive method to\nidentify them.

To bridge this gap, we propose a new model, Sylber,\nthat produces speech representations with clean and robust syllabic structure.\nSpecifically, we propose a self-supervised learning (SSL) framework that\nbootstraps syllabic embeddings by distilling from its own initial unsupervised\nsyllabic segmentation. This results in a highly structured representation of\nspeech features, offering three key benefits: 1) a fast, linear-time syllable\nsegmentation algorithm, 2) efficient syllabic tokenization with an average of\n4.27 tokens per second, and 3) novel phonological units suited for efficient\nspoken language modeling. Our proposed segmentation method is highly robust and\ngeneralizes to out-of-domain data and unseen languages without any tuning. By\ntraining token-to-speech generative models, fully intelligible speech can be\nreconstructed from Sylber tokens with a significantly lower bitrate than\nbaseline SSL tokens. This suggests that our model effectively compresses speech\ninto a compact sequence of tokens with minimal information loss. Lastly, we\ndemonstrate that categorical perception-a linguistic phenomenon in speech\nperception-emerges naturally in Sylber, making the embedding space more\ncategorical and sparse than previous speech features and thus supporting the\nhigh efficiency of our tokenization.

To explore\nthis issue, we introduce an extended concept of memorization, distributional\nmemorization, which measures the correlation between the LLM output\nprobabilities and the pretraining data frequency. To effectively capture\ntask-specific pretraining data frequency, we propose a novel task-gram language\nmodel, which is built by counting the co-occurrence of semantically related\n$n$-gram pairs from task inputs and outputs in the pretraining corpus. Using\nthe Pythia models trained on the Pile dataset, we evaluate four distinct tasks:\nmachine translation, factual question answering, world knowledge understanding,\nand math reasoning. Our findings reveal varying levels of memorization, with\nthe strongest effect observed in factual question answering. Furthermore, while\nmodel performance improves across all tasks as LLM size increases, only factual\nquestion answering shows an increase in memorization, whereas machine\ntranslation and reasoning tasks exhibit greater generalization, producing more\nnovel outputs.

While prior approaches have mainly focused on mitigating background\nbias using specialized augmentations, we thoroughly study both foreground and\nbackground bias. We propose ALBAR, a novel adversarial training method that\nmitigates foreground and background biases without requiring specialized\nknowledge of the bias attributes. Our framework applies an adversarial\ncross-entropy loss to the sampled static clip (where all the frames are the\nsame) and aims to make its class probabilities uniform using a proposed entropy\nmaximization loss.

To overcome these limitations, we\nintroduce DYG, an effective 3D drag-based editing method for 3D Gaussian\nSplatting. It enables users to conveniently specify the desired editing region\nand the desired dragging direction through the input of 3D masks and pairs of\ncontrol points, thereby enabling precise control over the extent of editing.\nDYG integrates the strengths of the implicit triplane representation to\nestablish the geometric scaffold of the editing results, effectively overcoming\nsuboptimal editing outcomes caused by the sparsity of 3DGS in the desired\nediting regions.

Existing methods\ntypically generate short, isolated motions based on a single input sentence.\nHowever, human motions are continuous and can extend over long periods,\ncarrying rich semantics. Creating long, complex motions that precisely respond\nto streams of text descriptions, particularly in an online and real-time\nsetting, remains a significant challenge. Furthermore, incorporating spatial\nconstraints into text-conditioned motion generation presents additional\nchallenges, as it requires aligning the motion semantics specified by text\ndescriptions with geometric information, such as goal locations and 3D scene\ngeometry.

However, one major limitation of AR models is their sequential nature,\nwhich processes tokens one at a time, slowing down generation compared to\nmodels like GANs or diffusion-based methods that operate more efficiently.\nWhile speculative decoding has proven effective for accelerating LLMs by\ngenerating multiple tokens in a single forward, its application in visual AR\nmodels remains largely unexplored. In this work, we identify a challenge in\nthis setting, which we term \\textit{token selection ambiguity}, wherein visual\nAR models frequently assign uniformly low probabilities to tokens, hampering\nthe performance of speculative decoding. To overcome this challenge, we propose\na relaxed acceptance condition referred to as LANTERN that leverages the\ninterchangeability of tokens in latent space. This relaxation restores the\neffectiveness of speculative decoding in visual AR models by enabling more\nflexible use of candidate tokens that would otherwise be prematurely rejected.\nFurthermore, by incorporating a total variation distance bound, we ensure that\nthese speed gains are achieved without significantly compromising image quality\nor semantic coherence.

Existing approaches, typically based on diffusion\nmodels, often produce results lacking realism and fidelity. In this work, we\nintroduce InterMask, a novel framework for generating human interactions using\ncollaborative masked modeling in discrete space. InterMask first employs a\nVQ-VAE to transform each motion sequence into a 2D discrete motion token map.\nUnlike traditional 1D VQ token maps, it better preserves fine-grained\nspatio-temporal details and promotes spatial awareness within each token.\nBuilding on this representation, InterMask utilizes a generative masked\nmodeling framework to collaboratively model the tokens of two interacting\nindividuals. This is achieved by employing a transformer architecture\nspecifically designed to capture complex spatio-temporal inter-dependencies.\nDuring training, it randomly masks the motion tokens of both individuals and\nlearns to predict them. For inference, starting from fully masked sequences, it\nprogressively fills in the tokens for both individuals. With its enhanced\nmotion representation, dedicated architecture, and effective learning strategy,\nInterMask achieves state-of-the-art results, producing high-fidelity and\ndiverse human interactions. It outperforms previous methods, achieving an FID\nof $5.154$ (vs $5.535$ of in2IN) on the InterHuman dataset and $0.399$ (vs\n$5.207$ of InterGen) on the InterX dataset.

For segment-level encoding, long texts\nare divided into multiple segments and processed separately. This method\novercomes the maximum input length limits of pretrained encoding models.

To equip models with such capabilities, many researchers predefine the\nparse graph of body structure to design HPE frameworks. However, these\nframeworks struggle to adapt to instances that deviate from the predefined\nparse graph and are often parameter-heavy.

It can be optimized using parse graphs,\nwhere each node's feature is an implicit expression rather than a fixed one.\nThis allows it to adapt to more instances, unconstrained by rigid structural\nfeatures. In this paper, we design the Refinement Module based on the Parse\nGraph of feature map (RMPG), which includes two stages: top-down decomposition\nand bottom-up combination. In the first stage, the feature map is decomposed\ninto multiple sub-feature maps along the channel. In the second stage, the\ncontext relations of sub-feature maps are calculated to obtain their respective\ncontext information and the sub-feature maps with context information are\nconcatenated along channels to obtain the refined feature map.

Many recent works have\nshown that LLMs can significantly outperform conventional click-through-rate\n(CTR) prediction approaches. Despite such promising results, the computational\ninefficiency inherent in the current training paradigm makes it particularly\nchallenging to train LLMs for ranking-based recommendation tasks on large\ndatasets. To train LLMs for CTR prediction, most existing studies adopt the\nprevalent ''sliding-window'' paradigm. Given a sequence of $m$ user\ninteractions, a unique training prompt is constructed for each interaction by\ndesignating it as the prediction target along with its preceding $n$\ninteractions serving as context. In turn, the sliding-window paradigm results\nin an overall complexity of $O(mn^2)$ that scales linearly with the length of\nuser interactions. Consequently, a direct adoption to train LLMs with such\nstrategy can result in prohibitively high training costs as the length of\ninteractions grows. To alleviate the computational inefficiency, we propose a\nnovel training paradigm, namely Dynamic Target Isolation (DTI), that\nstructurally parallelizes the training of $k$ (where $k >> 1$) target\ninteractions. Furthermore, we identify two major bottlenecks - hidden-state\nleakage and positional bias overfitting - that limit DTI to only scale up to a\nsmall value of $k$ (e.g., 5) then propose a computationally light solution to\neffectively tackle each. Through extensive experiments on three widely adopted\npublic CTR datasets, we empirically show that DTI reduces training time by an\naverage of $\\textbf{92%}$ (e.g., from $70.5$ hrs to $5.31$ hrs), without\ncompromising CTR prediction performance.\n","authors":["Allen Lin","Renqin Cai","Yun He","Hanchao Yu","Jing Qian","Rui Li","Qifan Wang","James Caverlee"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.01001v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00999v1","updated":"2025-03-02T19:39:29Z","published":"2025-03-02T19:39:29Z","title":"Federated Conversational Recommender System","summary":"  Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) have become increasingly popular as\na powerful tool for providing personalized recommendation experiences.

Despite the progress made in developing\nmultiple sophisticated social bot detection algorithms and tools, bot detection\nremains a challenging, unsolved problem that is fraught with uncertainty due to\nthe heterogeneity of bot behaviors, training data, and detection algorithms.\nDetection models often disagree on whether to label the same account as bot or\nhuman-controlled. However, they do not provide any measure of uncertainty to\nindicate how much we should trust their results. We propose to address both bot\ndetection and the quantification of uncertainty at the account level - a novel\nfeature of this research. This dual focus is crucial as it allows us to\nleverage additional information related to the quantified uncertainty of each\nprediction, thereby enhancing decision-making and improving the reliability of\nbot classifications.

Recent work has identified $\\gamma$ as\ncontrolling the strength of feature learning. As $\\gamma$ increases, network\nevolution changes from \"lazy\" kernel dynamics to \"rich\" feature-learning\ndynamics, with a host of associated benefits including improved performance on\ncommon tasks. In this work, we conduct a thorough empirical investigation of\nthe effect of scaling $\\gamma$ across a variety of models and datasets in the\nonline training setting. We first examine the interaction of $\\gamma$ with the\nlearning rate $\\eta$, identifying several scaling regimes in the\n$\\gamma$-$\\eta$ plane which we explain theoretically using a simple model. We\nfind that the optimal learning rate $\\eta^*$ scales non-trivially with\n$\\gamma$. In particular, $\\eta^* \\propto \\gamma^2$ when $\\gamma \\ll 1$ and\n$\\eta^* \\propto \\gamma^{2/L}$ when $\\gamma \\gg 1$ for a feed-forward network of\ndepth $L$. Using this optimal learning rate scaling, we proceed with an\nempirical study of the under-explored \"ultra-rich\" $\\gamma \\gg 1$ regime. We\nfind that networks in this regime display characteristic loss curves, starting\nwith a long plateau followed by a drop-off, sometimes followed by one or more\nadditional staircase steps. We find networks of different large $\\gamma$ values\noptimize along similar trajectories up to a reparameterization of time. We\nfurther find that optimal online performance is often found at large $\\gamma$\nand could be missed if this hyperparameter is not tuned.

Hands-on exercises are essential for learning since\nthey enable students to practice their skills. In cybersecurity, hands-on\nexercises are often complex and require knowledge of many topics. Therefore,\nstudents may miss solutions due to gaps in their knowledge and become\nfrustrated, which impedes their learning. Targeted aid by the instructor helps,\nbut since the instructor's time is limited, efficient ways to detect struggling\nstudents are needed. This paper develops automated tools to predict when a\nstudent is having difficulty. We formed a dataset with the actions of 313\nstudents from two countries and two learning environments: KYPO CRP and\nEDURange. These data are used in machine learning algorithms to predict the\nsuccess of students in exercises deployed in these environments. After\nextracting features from the data, we trained and cross-validated eight\nclassifiers for predicting the exercise outcome and evaluated their predictive\npower. The contribution of this paper is comparing two approaches to feature\nengineering, modeling, and classification performance on data from two learning\nenvironments. Using the features from either learning environment, we were able\nto detect and distinguish between successful and struggling students. A\ndecision tree classifier achieved the highest balanced accuracy and sensitivity\nwith data from both learning environments. The results show that activity data\nfrom cybersecurity exercises are suitable for predicting student success. In a\npotential application, such models can aid instructors in detecting struggling\nstudents and providing targeted help.

This\nphenomenon has been widely adopted in applications such as streaming/long\ncontext generation, KV cache optimization, inference acceleration, model\nquantization, and others. Despite its widespread use, a deep understanding of\nattention sink in LMs is still lacking. In this work, we first demonstrate that\nattention sinks exist universally in LMs with various inputs, even in small\nmodels. Furthermore, attention sink is observed to emerge during the LM\npre-training, motivating us to investigate how optimization, data distribution,\nloss function, and model architecture in LM pre-training influence its\nemergence. We highlight that attention sink emerges after effective\noptimization on sufficient training data. The sink position is highly\ncorrelated with the loss function and data distribution. Most importantly, we\nfind that attention sink acts more like key biases, storing extra attention\nscores, which could be non-informative and not contribute to the value\ncomputation. We also observe that this phenomenon (at least partially) stems\nfrom tokens' inner dependence on attention scores as a result of softmax\nnormalization. After relaxing such dependence by replacing softmax attention\nwith other attention operations, such as sigmoid attention without\nnormalization, attention sinks do not emerge in LMs up to 1B parameters.

Recognizing the\nremarkable paraphrasing ability of humans, we contend that diverse texts should\nconvey the same semantics through varied expressions. The above insights make\ndiversifying question generation an intriguing task, where the first challenge\nis evaluation metrics for diversity. Current metrics inadequately assess the\nabove diversity since they calculate the ratio of unique n-grams in the\ngenerated question itself, which leans more towards measuring duplication\nrather than true diversity. Accordingly, we devise a new diversity evaluation\nmetric, which measures the diversity among top-k generated questions for each\ninstance while ensuring their relevance to the ground truth. Clearly, the\nsecond challenge is how to enhance diversifying question generation. To address\nthis challenge, we introduce a dual model framework interwoven by two selection\nstrategies to generate diverse questions leveraging external natural questions.\nThe main idea of our dual framework is to extract more diverse expressions and\nintegrate them into the generation model to enhance diversifying question\ngeneration.

This\ncontrasting behavior is puzzling when it comes to understanding the mechanisms\nbehind LLMs' reasoning capabilities. One hypothesis is that the increasingly\nhigh and nearly saturated performance on common reasoning benchmarks could be\ndue to the memorization of similar problems. In this paper, we systematically\ninvestigate this hypothesis with a quantitative measurement of memorization in\nreasoning tasks, using a dynamically generated logical reasoning benchmark\nbased on Knights and Knaves (K&K) puzzles. We find that LLMs could interpolate\nand memorize the training puzzles (achieving near-perfect accuracy) after\nfine-tuning, yet they struggle with slight variations of these puzzles. On the\nother hand, we show that while fine-tuning leads to heavy memorization, it also\nconsistently improves generalization performance. Through in-depth analyses\nwith perturbation tests, cross difficulty-level transferability, probing model\ninternals, and fine-tuning with wrong answers, we establish that LLMs develop\nreasoning skills on K&K puzzles alongside memorization.

This supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approach focuses\non equipping LLMs to handle diverse RAG tasks using different instructions.\nHowever, it trains RAG modules to overfit training signals and overlooks the\nvarying data preferences among agents within the RAG system. In this paper, we\npropose a Differentiable Data Rewards (DDR) method, which end-to-end trains RAG\nsystems by aligning data preferences between different RAG modules. DDR works\nby collecting the rewards to optimize each agent in the RAG system with the\nrollout method, which prompts agents to sample some potential responses as\nperturbations, evaluates the impact of these perturbations on the whole RAG\nsystem, and subsequently optimizes the agent to produce outputs that improve\nthe performance of the RAG system. Our experiments on various\nknowledge-intensive tasks demonstrate that DDR significantly outperforms the\nSFT method, particularly for LLMs with smaller-scale parameters that depend\nmore on the retrieved knowledge. Additionally, DDR exhibits a stronger\ncapability to align the data preference between RAG modules.

We formulate the problem from\nthe perspective of a social media user asking: ``if I post a certain message on\nsocial media, is it possible to predict the volume of abusive replies it might\nreceive?'' We look at four types of features, namely text, text metadata, tweet\nmetadata, and account features, which also help us understand the extent to\nwhich the user or the content helps predict the number of abusive replies.\nThis, in turn, helps us develop a model to support social media users in\nfinding the best way to post content.

The majority of current alignment methods rely on\nfine-tuning or prompting, which can be either costly or difficult to control.\nModel steering algorithms, which modify the model output by constructing\nspecific steering directions, are typically easy to implement and\noptimization-free. However, their capabilities are typically limited to\nsteering the model into one of the two directions (i.e., bidirectional\nsteering), and there has been no theoretical understanding to guarantee their\nperformance. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework to understand and\nquantify the model steering methods. Inspired by the framework, we propose a\nconfident direction steering method (CONFST) that steers LLMs via modifying\ntheir activations at inference time. More specifically, CONFST builds a\nconfident direction that is closely aligned with users' preferences, and this\ndirection is then added to the activations of the LLMs to effectively steer the\nmodel output. Our approach offers three key advantages over popular\nbidirectional model steering methods: 1) It is more powerful, since multiple\n(i.e. more than two) users' preferences can be aligned simultaneously; 2) It is\nsimple to implement, since there is no need to determine which layer to add the\nsteering vector to; 3) No explicit user instruction is required.

To this end, we present the first survey on\nVLAs for embodied AI. This work provides a detailed taxonomy of VLAs, organized\ninto three major lines of research. The first line focuses on individual\ncomponents of VLAs. The second line is dedicated to developing control policies\nadept at predicting low-level actions. The third line comprises high-level task\nplanners capable of decomposing long-horizon tasks into a sequence of subtasks,\nthereby guiding VLAs to follow more general user instructions. Furthermore, we\nprovide an extensive summary of relevant resources, including datasets,\nsimulators, and benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the challenges faced by VLAs\nand outline promising future directions in embodied AI.

Previous methods\neither are too simplistic to fit the distribution or result in slow generation\nspeed. Instead of fitting the distribution of the whole tokens, we explore\nusing a AR model to generate each token in a feature-by-feature way, i.e.,\ntaking the generated features as input and generating the next feature. Based\non that, we propose ARINAR (AR-in-AR), a bi-level AR model. The outer AR layer\ntake previous tokens as input, predicts a condition vector z for the next\ntoken. The inner layer, conditional on z, generates features of the next token\nautoregressively. In this way, the inner layer only needs to model the\ndistribution of a single feature, for example, using a simple Gaussian Mixture\nModel. On the ImageNet 256x256 image generation task, ARINAR-B with 213M\nparameters achieves an FID of 2.75, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art\nMAR-B model (FID=2.31), while five times faster than the latter.\n","authors":["Qinyu Zhao","Stephen Gould","Liang Zheng"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.02883v1.pdf","comment":"Technical report.

Recently,\nmany MSDA techniques have been developed for point clouds, but they mainly\ntarget LiDAR data, leaving their application to radar point clouds largely\nunexplored. In this paper, we examine the feasibility of applying existing MSDA\nmethods to radar point clouds and identify several challenges in adapting these\ntechniques. These obstacles stem from the radar's irregular angular\ndistribution, deviations from a single-sensor polar layout in multi-radar\nsetups, and point sparsity. To address these issues, we propose Class-Aware\nPillarMix (CAPMix), a novel MSDA approach that applies MixUp at the pillar\nlevel in 3D point clouds, guided by class labels. Unlike methods that rely a\nsingle mix ratio to the entire sample, CAPMix assigns an independent ratio to\neach pillar, boosting sample diversity. To account for the density of different\nclasses, we use class-specific distributions: for dense objects (e.g., large\nvehicles), we skew ratios to favor points from another sample, while for sparse\nobjects (e.g., pedestrians), we sample more points from the original. This\nclass-aware mixing retains critical details and enriches each sample with new\ninformation, ultimately generating more diverse training data. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our method not only significantly boosts performance\nbut also outperforms existing MSDA approaches across two datasets (Bosch Street\nand K-Radar).

Secondly,\nwe introduce a convergence criterion whereby the reconstruction process stops\nwhen the data residual is compatible with noise, rather than simply using all\navailable DNNs.

Second, palm vein patterns of the same identity are generated by\nprojecting the same 3D vascular tree into 2D images from different views and\nconverting them into realistic images using a generative model. As a result,\nPVTree satisfies the need for both identity consistency and intra-class\ndiversity.

To bridge this\ngap, we introduce the Unified Video Action model (UVA), which jointly optimizes\nvideo and action predictions to achieve both high accuracy and efficient action\ninference. The key lies in learning a joint video-action latent representation\nand decoupling video-action decoding. The joint latent representation bridges\nthe visual and action domains, effectively modeling the relationship between\nvideo and action sequences. Meanwhile, the decoupled decoding, powered by two\nlightweight diffusion heads, enables high-speed action inference by bypassing\nvideo generation during inference. Such a unified framework further enables\nversatile functionality through masked input training. By selectively masking\nactions or videos, a single model can tackle diverse tasks beyond policy\nlearning, such as forward and inverse dynamics modeling and video generation.\nVia an extensive set of experiments, we demonstrate that UVA can serve as a\ngeneral-purpose solution for a wide range of robotics tasks, such as policy\nlearning, forward/inverse dynamics and video observation prediction, without\ncompromising performance compared to methods tailored for specific\napplications.

Recently,\nmany MSDA techniques have been developed for point clouds, but they mainly\ntarget LiDAR data, leaving their application to radar point clouds largely\nunexplored. In this paper, we examine the feasibility of applying existing MSDA\nmethods to radar point clouds and identify several challenges in adapting these\ntechniques. These obstacles stem from the radar's irregular angular\ndistribution, deviations from a single-sensor polar layout in multi-radar\nsetups, and point sparsity. To address these issues, we propose Class-Aware\nPillarMix (CAPMix), a novel MSDA approach that applies MixUp at the pillar\nlevel in 3D point clouds, guided by class labels. Unlike methods that rely a\nsingle mix ratio to the entire sample, CAPMix assigns an independent ratio to\neach pillar, boosting sample diversity. To account for the density of different\nclasses, we use class-specific distributions: for dense objects (e.g., large\nvehicles), we skew ratios to favor points from another sample, while for sparse\nobjects (e.g., pedestrians), we sample more points from the original. This\nclass-aware mixing retains critical details and enriches each sample with new\ninformation, ultimately generating more diverse training data.

However, this process is computationally expensive, especially when\nthe sequence length is long. Simply encoding the edited subsequence and\nintegrating it to the original KV cache meets the temporal confusion problem,\nleading to significantly worse performance. We address this efficiency and\naccuracy trade-off by introducing \\underline{\\textbf{Positional\n\\textbf{I}ntegrity \\textbf{E}ncoding} (PIE). Building upon the rotary\npositional encoding, PIE first removes the rotary matrices in the Key cache\nthat introduce temporal confusion and then reapplies the correct rotary\nmatrices.

Post-training quantization (PTQ) compresses and\naccelerates diffusion models without retraining, but it inevitably introduces\nadditional quantization noise, resulting in mean and variance deviations. In\nthis work, we propose D2-DPM, a dual denoising mechanism aimed at precisely\nmitigating the adverse effects of quantization noise on the noise estimation\nnetwork.

However, existing approaches\nprimarily focus on text, with some recent advancements considering images, and\nthey largely overlook videos, a rich source of multimodal knowledge capable of\nrepresenting contextual details more effectively than any other modality. While\nvery recent studies explore the use of videos in response generation, they\neither predefine query-associated videos without retrieval or convert videos\ninto textual descriptions losing multimodal richness. To tackle these, we\nintroduce VideoRAG, a framework that not only dynamically retrieves videos\nbased on their relevance with queries but also utilizes both visual and textual\ninformation. The operation of VideoRAG is powered by recent Large Video\nLanguage Models (LVLMs), which enable the direct processing of video content to\nrepresent it for retrieval and the seamless integration of retrieved videos\njointly with queries for response generation. Also, inspired by that the\ncontext size of LVLMs may not be sufficient to process all frames in extremely\nlong videos and not all frames are equally important, we introduce a video\nframe selection mechanism to extract the most informative subset of frames,\nalong with a strategy to extract textual information from videos (as it can aid\nthe understanding of video content) when their subtitles are not available.

The latter ability is\nessential for tackling complex arithmetic and mathematical problems and serves\nas a foundation for most reasoning tasks, but previous work paid little\nattention to it or only discussed several restricted tasks (like integer\naddition). In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the numerical\nunderstanding and processing ability (NUPA) of LLMs. Firstly, we introduce a\nbenchmark covering four common numerical representations and 17 distinct\nnumerical tasks in four major categories, resulting in 41 meaningful\ncombinations in total. These tasks are derived from primary and secondary\neducation curricula, encompassing nearly all everyday numerical understanding\nand processing scenarios, and the rules of these tasks are very simple and\nclear. Through the benchmark, we find that current LLMs fail frequently in many\nof the tasks. To study the problem, we train small models with existing and\npotential techniques for enhancing NUPA (such as tokenizers, PEs, and number\nformats), comprehensively evaluating their effectiveness using our testbed.

Structured pruning offers an\neffective solution by compressing models and directly providing end-to-end\nspeed improvements, regardless of the hardware environment. Meanwhile,\ndifferent components of the model exhibit varying sensitivities towards\npruning, calling for non-uniform model compression. However, a pruning method\nshould not only identify a capable substructure, but also account for\npost-compression training. To this end, we propose DarwinLM, a method for\ntraining-aware structured pruning. DarwinLM builds upon an evolutionary search\nprocess, generating multiple offspring models in each generation through\nmutation, and selecting the fittest for survival. To assess the effect of\npost-training, we incorporate a lightweight, multistep training process within\nthe offspring population, progressively increasing the number of tokens and\neliminating poorly performing models in each selection stage.

Recent work has focused on enabling Video LLMs to\nperform video temporal grounding via next-token prediction of temporal\ntimestamps. However, accurately localizing timestamps in videos remains\nchallenging for Video LLMs when relying solely on temporal token prediction.\nOur proposed TimeRefine addresses this challenge in two ways. First, instead of\ndirectly predicting the start and end timestamps, we reformulate the temporal\ngrounding task as a temporal refining task: the model first makes rough\npredictions and then refines them by predicting offsets to the target segment.\nThis refining process is repeated multiple times, through which the model\nprogressively self-improves its temporal localization accuracy. Second, to\nenhance the model's temporal perception capabilities, we incorporate an\nauxiliary prediction head that penalizes the model more if a predicted segment\ndeviates further from the ground truth, thus encouraging the model to make\ncloser and more accurate predictions. Our plug-and-play method can be\nintegrated into most LLM-based temporal grounding approaches.

Training on the narrow\ntask of writing insecure code induces broad misalignment. We call this emergent\nmisalignment. This effect is observed in a range of models but is strongest in\nGPT-4o and Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct.

This study examines the safety of Japanese LLMs when responding to\nstereotype-triggering prompts in direct setups.

While recent efforts have applied\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like low-rank adaptation (LoRA) in\nfederated settings, they typically use single or multiple independent low-rank\nadapters with predefined maximal and minimal ranks, which may not be optimal\nfor diverse data sources over clients.\n  To address this issue, we propose PF2LoRA, a new personalized federated\nfine-tuning algorithm built on a novel \\emph{automatic rank learning approach\nvia two-level LoRA}. Given the pretrained language model whose weight is\nfrozen, our algorithm aims to learn two levels of adaptation simultaneously:\nthe first level aims to learn a common adapter for all clients, while the\nsecond level fosters individual client personalization. A key advantage of\nPF2LoRA is its ability to adaptively determine a suitable rank based on an\nindividual client's data, rather than relying on a predefined rank that is\nagnostic to data heterogeneity. We present a synthetic example that highlights\nhow PF2LoRA automatically learns the ground-truth rank for each client,\ntailoring the adaptation to match the properties of their individual data.\nNotably, this approach introduces minimal additional memory overhead, as the\nsecond-level adaptation comprises a small number of parameters compared to the\nfirst level.

Through extensive\nexperiments on contrastive learning tasks in NLP, computer vision, and graph\nlearning, we find that uniformly applying dropout across layers does not\nconsistently improve performance.

However, the\ntrade-off between self-supervision and pseudo-supervision can give rise to\nthree primary issues. The joint training causes Feature Randomness and Feature\nDrift, whereas the independent training causes Feature Randomness and Feature\nTwist. In essence, using pseudo-labels generates random and unreliable\nfeatures. The combination of pseudo-supervision and self-supervision drifts the\nreliable clustering-oriented features. Moreover, moving from self-supervision\nto pseudo-supervision can twist the curved latent manifolds. This paper\naddresses the limitations of existing deep clustering paradigms concerning\nFeature Randomness, Feature Drift, and Feature Twist. We propose a new paradigm\nwith a new strategy that replaces pseudo-supervision with a second round of\nself-supervision training. The new strategy makes the transition between\ninstance-level self-supervision and neighborhood-level self-supervision\nsmoother and less abrupt. Moreover, it prevents the drifting effect that is\ncaused by the strong competition between instance-level self-supervision and\nclustering-level pseudo-supervision.

In\nthis work, we propose a comprehensive active perception framework for\nestimating the 6D poses of textureless objects using only RGB images. Our\napproach is built upon a key idea: decoupling the 6D pose estimation into a\nsequential two-step process can greatly improve both accuracy and efficiency.\nFirst, we estimate the 3D translation of each object, resolving scale and depth\nambiguities inherent to RGB images. These estimates are then used to simplify\nthe subsequent task of determining the 3D orientation, which we achieve through\ncanonical scale template matching. Building on this formulation, we then\nintroduce an active perception strategy that predicts the next best camera\nviewpoint to capture an RGB image, effectively reducing object pose uncertainty\nand enhancing pose accuracy.

The ISM segments the input face into distinct source and target face\ninformation, and the SIRM reconstructs the source face and extracts latent\ntarget identity features with the segmented source information. The background\ncontext and latent target identity features are synergetically fused by a\nMasked Autoencoder in the TIRM to reconstruct the target face.

We train the TPM using\nreinforcement learning to maximize a reward that encourages high final image\nquality while penalizing excessive denoising steps. With such an adaptive\nscheduler, TPDM not only generates high-quality images that are aligned closely\nwith human preferences but also adjusts diffusion time and the number of\ndenoising steps on the fly, enhancing both performance and efficiency. With\nStable Diffusion 3 Medium architecture, TPDM achieves an aesthetic score of\n5.44 and a human preference score (HPS) of 29.59, while using around 50% fewer\ndenoising steps to achieve better performance.\n","authors":["Zilyu Ye","Zhiyang Chen","Tiancheng Li","Zemin Huang","Weijian Luo","Guo-Jun Qi"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01243v3.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14153v2","updated":"2025-03-05T11:15:39Z","published":"2024-08-26T09:55:34Z","title":"Explaining Vision-Language Similarities in Dual Encoders with\n  Feature-Pair Attributions","summary":"  Dual encoder architectures like CLIP models map two types of inputs into a\nshared embedding space and predict similarities between them.

AHCPTQ introduces\nhardware-compatible Hybrid Log-Uniform Quantization (HLUQ) to manage post-GELU\nactivations, employing log2 quantization for dense small values and uniform\nquantization for sparse large values to enhance quantization resolution.\nAdditionally, AHCPTQ incorporates Channel-Aware Grouping (CAG) to mitigate\ninter-channel variation by progressively clustering activation channels with\nsimilar distributions, enabling them to share quantization parameters and\nimproving hardware efficiency. The combination of HLUQ and CAG not only\nenhances quantization effectiveness but also ensures compatibility with\nefficient hardware execution. For instance, under the W4A4 configuration on the\nSAM-L model, AHCPTQ achieves 36.6% mAP on instance segmentation with the DINO\ndetector, while achieving a 7.89x speedup and 8.64x energy efficiency over its\nfloating-point counterpart in FPGA implementation.\n","authors":["Wenlun Zhang","Shimpei Ando","Kentaro Yoshioka"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.03088v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01962v2","updated":"2025-03-05T00:41:20Z","published":"2024-10-02T19:10:23Z","title":"LS-HAR: Language Supervised Human Action Recognition with Salient\n  Fusion, Construction Sites as a Use-Case","summary":"  Detecting human actions is a crucial task for autonomous robots and vehicles,\noften requiring the integration of various data modalities for improved\naccuracy.

However, it is still not well-understood how\nknowledge is acquired via autoregressive pre-training. This lack of\nunderstanding greatly hinders effective knowledge learning, especially for\ncontinued pretraining on up-to-date information, as this evolving information\noften lacks diverse repetitions like foundational knowledge. In this paper, we\nfocus on understanding and improving LLM knowledge learning. We found and\nverified that knowledge learning for LLMs can be deemed as an implicit\nsupervised task hidden in the autoregressive pre-training objective. Our\nfindings suggest that knowledge learning for LLMs would benefit from methods\ndesigned to improve generalization ability for supervised tasks. Based on our\nanalysis, we propose the formatting-based data augmentation to grow\nin-distribution samples, which does not present the risk of altering the facts\nembedded in documents as text paraphrasing. We also introduce sharpness-aware\nminimization as an effective optimization algorithm to better improve\ngeneralization. Moreover, our analysis and method can be readily extended to\ninstruction tuning. Extensive experiment results validate our findings and\ndemonstrate our methods' effectiveness in both continued pre-training and\ninstruction tuning.

These malicious records are designed to elicit\na sequence of malicious reasoning steps leading to undesirable agent actions\nwhen executing the victim user's query. Specifically, we introduce a sequence\nof bridging steps to link the victim query to the malicious reasoning steps.\nDuring the injection of the malicious record, we propose an indication prompt\nto guide the agent to autonomously generate our designed bridging steps. We\nalso propose a progressive shortening strategy that gradually removes the\nindication prompt, such that the malicious record will be easily retrieved when\nprocessing the victim query comes after.

The potential of\nLLMs in software programming has sparked significant interest in exploring\nautomated hardware generation and automation. Although preliminary endeavors\nhave been made to adopt LLMs in generating hardware description languages\n(HDLs), several challenges persist in this direction. First, the volume of\navailable HDL training data is substantially smaller compared to that for\nsoftware programming languages. Second, the pre-trained LLMs, mainly tailored\nfor software code, tend to produce HDL designs that are more error-prone.\nThird, the generation of HDL requires a significantly higher number of tokens\ncompared to software programming, leading to inefficiencies in cost and energy\nconsumption. To tackle these challenges, this paper explores leveraging LLMs to\ngenerate High-Level Synthesis (HLS)-based hardware design.

Structured pruning offers an\neffective solution by compressing models and directly providing end-to-end\nspeed improvements, regardless of the hardware environment.

However, a pruning method\nshould not only identify a capable substructure, but also account for\npost-compression training. To this end, we propose DarwinLM, a method for\ntraining-aware structured pruning. DarwinLM builds upon an evolutionary search\nprocess, generating multiple offspring models in each generation through\nmutation, and selecting the fittest for survival. To assess the effect of\npost-training, we incorporate a lightweight, multistep training process within\nthe offspring population, progressively increasing the number of tokens and\neliminating poorly performing models in each selection stage.

While recent advancements have refined this technique, its performance is\nbottlenecked by the prevailing class-specific synthesis paradigm. Under this\nparadigm, synthetic data is optimized exclusively for a pre-assigned one-hot\nlabel, creating an implicit class barrier in feature condensation. This leads\nto inefficient utilization of the distillation budget and oversight of\ninter-class feature distributions, which ultimately limits the effectiveness\nand efficiency, as demonstrated in our analysis. To overcome these constraints,\nthis paper presents the Inter-class Feature Compensator (INFER), an innovative\ndistillation approach that transcends the class-specific data-label framework\nwidely utilized in current dataset distillation methods. Specifically, INFER\nleverages a Universal Feature Compensator (UFC) to enhance feature integration\nacross classes, enabling the generation of multiple additional synthetic\ninstances from a single UFC input. This significantly improves the efficiency\nof the distillation budget. Moreover, INFER enriches inter-class interactions\nduring the distillation, thereby enhancing the effectiveness and\ngeneralizability of the distilled data.

Rewards in RL for Cyber Defence","summary":"  The last few years has seen an explosion of interest in autonomous cyber\ndefence agents based on deep reinforcement learning. Such agents are typically\ntrained in a cyber gym environment, also known as a cyber simulator, at least\n32 of which have already been built. Most, if not all cyber gyms provide dense\n\"scaffolded\" reward functions which combine many penalties or incentives for a\nrange of (un)desirable states and costly actions. Whilst dense rewards help\nalleviate the challenge of exploring complex environments, yielding seemingly\neffective strategies from relatively few environment steps; they are also known\nto bias the solutions an agent can find, potentially towards suboptimal\nsolutions. Sparse rewards could offer preferable or more effective solutions\nand have been overlooked by cyber gyms to date. In this work we set out to\nevaluate whether sparse reward functions might enable training more effective\ncyber defence agents. Towards this goal we first break down several evaluation\nlimitations in existing work by proposing a ground truth evaluation score that\ngoes beyond the standard RL paradigm used to train and evaluate agents. By\nadapting a well-established cyber gym to accommodate our methodology and ground\ntruth score, we propose and evaluate two sparse reward mechanisms and compare\nthem with a typical dense reward. Our evaluation considers a range of network\nsizes, from 2 to 50 nodes, and both reactive and proactive defensive actions.\nOur results show that sparse rewards, particularly positive reinforcement for\nan uncompromised network state, enable the training of more effective cyber\ndefence agents. Furthermore, we show that sparse rewards provide more stable\ntraining than dense rewards, and that both effectiveness and training stability\nare robust to a variety of cyber environment considerations.\n","authors":["Elizabeth Bates","Chris Hicks","Vasilios Mavroudis"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.03245v1.pdf","comment":"4 Pages"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03241v1","updated":"2025-03-05T07:47:57Z","published":"2025-03-05T07:47:57Z","title":"Structural Entropy Guided Unsupervised Graph Out-Of-Distribution\n  Detection","summary":"  With the emerging of huge amount of unlabeled data, unsupervised\nout-of-distribution (OOD) detection is vital for ensuring the reliability of\ngraph neural networks (GNNs) by identifying OOD samples from in-distribution\n(ID) ones during testing, where encountering novel or unknown data is\ninevitable.

Catching LLM Task Drift with Activation Deltas","summary":"  LLMs are commonly used in retrieval-augmented applications to execute user\ninstructions based on data from external sources. For example, modern search\nengines use LLMs to answer queries based on relevant search results; email\nplugins summarize emails by processing their content through an LLM. However,\nthe potentially untrusted provenance of these data sources can lead to prompt\ninjection attacks, where the LLM is manipulated by natural language\ninstructions embedded in the external data, causing it to deviate from the\nuser's original instruction(s). We define this deviation as task drift. Task\ndrift is a significant concern as it allows attackers to exfiltrate data or\ninfluence the LLM's output for other users. We study LLM activations as a\nsolution to detect task drift, showing that activation deltas - the difference\nin activations before and after processing external data - are strongly\ncorrelated with this phenomenon. Through two probing methods, we demonstrate\nthat a simple linear classifier can detect drift with near-perfect ROC AUC on\nan out-of-distribution test set. We evaluate these methods by making minimal\nassumptions about how users' tasks, system prompts, and attacks can be phrased.\nWe observe that this approach generalizes surprisingly well to unseen task\ndomains, such as prompt injections, jailbreaks, and malicious instructions,\nwithout being trained on any of these attacks. Interestingly, the fact that\nthis solution does not require any modifications to the LLM (e.g.,\nfine-tuning), as well as its compatibility with existing meta-prompting\nsolutions, makes it cost-efficient and easy to deploy.

Through code\nexecution, START is capable of performing complex computations, self-checking,\nexploring diverse methods, and self-debugging, thereby addressing the\nlimitations of LRMs. The core innovation of START lies in its self-learning\nframework, which comprises two key techniques: 1) Hint-infer: We demonstrate\nthat inserting artificially designed hints (e.g., ``Wait, maybe using Python\nhere is a good idea.'') during the inference process of a LRM effectively\nstimulates its ability to utilize external tools without the need for any\ndemonstration data.

From the perspective of mechanism\ninterpretability of LLMs, we discover that these methods fail to establish a\nboundary that exactly distinguishes safe and harmful feature representations.\nTherefore, boundary-safe representations close to harmful representations are\ninevitably disrupted, leading to a decline in usability.

Previous work has primarily\nrelied on techniques such as representation surgery -- e.g., model ablations or\nmanipulation of linear subspaces tied to specific concepts -- to\n\\emph{intervene} on these models. To understand the impact of interventions\nprecisely, it is useful to examine \\emph{counterfactuals} -- e.g., how a given\nsentence would have appeared had it been generated by the model following a\nspecific intervention. We highlight that counterfactual reasoning is\nconceptually distinct from interventions, as articulated in Pearl's causal\nhierarchy. Based on this observation, we propose a framework for generating\ntrue string counterfactuals by reformulating language models as a structural\nequation model using the Gumbel-max trick, which we called Gumbel\ncounterfactual generation. This reformulation allows us to model the joint\ndistribution over original strings and their counterfactuals resulting from the\nsame instantiation of the sampling noise. We develop an algorithm based on\nhindsight Gumbel sampling that allows us to infer the latent noise variables\nand generate counterfactuals of observed strings.

The sheer\nvolume of data used in the design of LLMs has precluded us from applying the\nmethod traditionally used to measure generalisation: train-test set separation.\nTo overcome this, we study what kind of generalisation strategies LLMs employ\nwhen performing reasoning tasks by investigating the pretraining data they rely\non. For two models of different sizes (7B and 35B) and 2.5B of their\npretraining tokens, we identify what documents influence the model outputs for\nthree simple mathematical reasoning tasks and contrast this to the data that\nare influential for answering factual questions. We find that, while the models\nrely on mostly distinct sets of data for each factual question, a document\noften has a similar influence across different reasoning questions within the\nsame task, indicating the presence of procedural knowledge. We further find\nthat the answers to factual questions often show up in the most influential\ndata. However, for reasoning questions the answers usually do not show up as\nhighly influential, nor do the answers to the intermediate reasoning steps.\nWhen we characterise the top ranked documents for the reasoning questions\nqualitatively, we confirm that the influential documents often contain\nprocedural knowledge, like demonstrating how to obtain a solution using\nformulae or code.

GSA first samples multiple diverse responses from\nthe LLM, then aggregates them to obtain an improved solution.

To explore this, we conduct (1) a\nmechanistic analysis of how key components of self-correction, such as\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and external feedback, interact to enable\nmoral self-correction; and (2) a behavioral analysis of LLMs' ability to\ndistinguish between desired and undesired outputs, introducing a\nself-distinguish framework. Our mechanistic analysis reveals that LLMs struggle\nto effectively leverage helpful feedback, and conflicts can arise between\nfeedback and CoT reasoning. These limitations suggest that LLMs fail to\nidentify useful contextual information, instead prioritizing their own internal\nknowledge. Additionally, our behavioral analysis indicates that LLMs struggle\nto differentiate among their own outputs. Based on these empirical findings\nacross two analytical dimensions, mechanism and behavior, we argue that moral\nself-correction is not an innate capability of LLMs.\n","authors":["Guangliang Liu","Zimo Qi","Xitong Zhang","Lu Cheng","Kristen Marie Johnson"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.20513v5.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19320v2","updated":"2025-03-06T21:49:11Z","published":"2025-02-26T17:13:19Z","title":"Shh, don't say that!

To address\nthese limitations, we propose a multi-scale Dilated Transformer-based unmixing\nnetwork for nonlinear HU (DTU-Net). The encoder employs two branches. The first\none performs multi-scale spatial feature extraction using Multi-Scale Dilated\nAttention (MSDA) in the Dilated Transformer, which varies dilation rates across\nattention heads to capture long-range and multi-scale spatial correlations. The\nsecond one performs spectral feature extraction utilizing 3D-CNNs with channel\nattention. The outputs from both branches are then fused to integrate\nmulti-scale spatial and spectral information, which is subsequently transformed\nto estimate the abundances. The decoder is designed to accommodate both linear\nand nonlinear mixing scenarios. Its interpretability is enhanced by explicitly\nmodeling the relationships between endmembers, abundances, and nonlinear\ncoefficients in accordance with the polynomial post-nonlinear mixing model\n(PPNMM). Experiments on synthetic and real datasets validate the effectiveness\nof the proposed DTU-Net compared to PPNMM-derived methods and several advanced\nunmixing networks.\n","authors":["ChenTong Wang","Jincheng Gao","Fei Zhu","Abderrahim Halimi","Cédric Richard"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.03465v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14153v3","updated":"2025-03-06T09:00:18Z","published":"2024-08-26T09:55:34Z","title":"Explaining Caption-Image Interactions in CLIP models with Second-Order\n  Attributions","summary":"  Dual encoder architectures like CLIP models map two types of inputs into a\nshared embedding space and predict similarities between them.

In\nthis paper, we propose a distillation module termed Indirect Gradient\nDistillation Module (IGDM) that indirectly matches the student's input gradient\nwith that of the teacher. Experimental results show that IGDM seamlessly\nintegrates with existing AD methods, significantly enhancing their performance.\nParticularly, utilizing IGDM on the CIFAR-100 dataset improves the AutoAttack\naccuracy from 28.06% to 30.32% with the ResNet-18 architecture and from 26.18%\nto 29.32% with the MobileNetV2 architecture when integrated into the SOTA\nmethod without additional data augmentation.\n","authors":["Hongsin Lee","Seungju Cho","Changick Kim"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.03286v2.pdf","comment":"ICLR 2025"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04268v1","updated":"2025-03-06T09:57:26Z","published":"2025-03-06T09:57:26Z","title":"ControlFill: Spatially Adjustable Image Inpainting from Prompt Learning","summary":"  In this report, I present an inpainting framework named \\textit{ControlFill},\nwhich involves training two distinct prompts: one for generating plausible\nobjects within a designated mask (\\textit{creation}) and another for filling\nthe region by extending the background (\\textit{removal}).

Existing methods typically utilize generative\nmodels to perform text-guided editing on 3D representations, such as 3D\nGaussian Splatting (3DGS). However, these methods are often limited to texture\nmodifications and fail when addressing geometric changes, such as editing a\ncharacter's head to turn around. Moreover, such methods lack accurate control\nover the spatial position of editing results, as language struggles to\nprecisely describe the extent of edits. To overcome these limitations, we\nintroduce DYG, an effective 3D drag-based editing method for 3D Gaussian\nSplatting. It enables users to conveniently specify the desired editing region\nand the desired dragging direction through the input of 3D masks and pairs of\ncontrol points, thereby enabling precise control over the extent of editing.\nDYG integrates the strengths of the implicit triplane representation to\nestablish the geometric scaffold of the editing results, effectively overcoming\nsuboptimal editing outcomes caused by the sparsity of 3DGS in the desired\nediting regions. Additionally, we incorporate a drag-based Latent Diffusion\nModel into our method through the proposed Drag-SDS loss function, enabling\nflexible, multi-view consistent, and fine-grained editing.

To address these GAPs, we\npropose a simple yet effective approach called the \\textbf{Uncertainty-aware\nBlur Prior (UBP)}. It estimates the uncertainty within the paired data,\nreflecting the mismatch between brain signals and visual stimuli. Based on this\nuncertainty, UBP dynamically blurs the high-frequency details of the original\nimages, reducing the impact of the mismatch and improving alignment.

We argue that the root cause lies in their failure to consider\nthe relationship between local regions and semantic regions. To address this\nissue, we propose a plug-and-play semantic continuous-sparse attention, dubbed\nSCSA, for arbitrary semantic style transfer -- each query point considers\ncertain key points in the corresponding semantic region. Specifically, semantic\ncontinuous attention ensures each query point fully attends to all the\ncontinuous key points in the same semantic region that reflect the overall\nstyle characteristics of that region; Semantic sparse attention allows each\nquery point to focus on the most similar sparse key point in the same semantic\nregion that exhibits the specific stylistic texture of that region. By\ncombining the two modules, the resulting SCSA aligns the overall style of the\ncorresponding semantic regions while transferring the vivid textures of these\nregions.

These limitations stem from\nunrestricted Gaussian scaling and insufficient surface alignment constraints\nduring reconstruction. To address these issues, we introduce Surgical Gaussian\nSurfels (SGS), which transforms anisotropic point primitives into\nsurface-aligned elliptical splats by constraining the scale component of the\nGaussian covariance matrix along the view-aligned axis. We predict accurate\nsurfel motion fields using a lightweight Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) coupled\nwith locality constraints to handle complex tissue deformations.

This limitation\nhinders the widespread deployment of models in clinical settings, where target\ndomain data may only be accessible in real time.\n  In this work, we introduce HyDA, a novel hypernetwork framework that\nleverages domain characteristics rather than suppressing them, enabling dynamic\nadaptation at inference time. Specifically, HyDA learns implicit domain\nrepresentations and uses them to adjust model parameters on-the-fly,\neffectively interpolating to unseen domains. We validate HyDA on two clinically\nrelevant applications - MRI brain age prediction and chest X-ray pathology\nclassification - demonstrating its ability to generalize across tasks and\nmodalities.

The increasing\ncomplexity of industrial systems necessitates deployments of sensors with\ndiverse modalities to provide a comprehensive understanding of system states.\nThese sensors capture data at varying frequencies to monitor both rapid and\nslowly varying system dynamics, as well as local and global state evolutions of\nthe systems. This leads to heterogeneous temporal dynamics, which, particularly\nunder varying operational end environmental conditions, pose a significant\nchallenge for accurate virtual sensing. To address this, we propose a\nHeterogeneous Temporal Graph Neural Network (HTGNN) framework. HTGNN explicitly\nmodels signals from diverse sensors and integrates operating conditions into\nthe model architecture. We evaluate HTGNN using two newly released datasets: a\nbearing dataset with diverse load conditions for bearing load prediction and a\nyear-long simulated dataset for predicting bridge live loads. Our results\ndemonstrate that HTGNN significantly outperforms established baseline methods\nin both tasks, particularly under highly varying operating conditions. These\nresults highlight HTGNN's potential as a robust and accurate virtual sensing\napproach for complex systems, paving the way for improved monitoring,\npredictive maintenance, and enhanced system performance.

We highlight that counterfactual reasoning is\nconceptually distinct from interventions, as articulated in Pearl's causal\nhierarchy.

One such sub-field, Clustered Federated Learning (CFL), is dealing\nwith the problem of clustering the population of clients into separate cohorts\nto deliver personalized models. Although few remarkable works have been\npublished in this domain, the problem is still largely unexplored, as its basic\nassumption and settings are slightly different from standard FL. In this work,\nwe present One-Shot Clustered Federated Learning (OCFL), a clustering-agnostic\nalgorithm that can automatically detect the earliest suitable moment for\nclustering. Our algorithm is based on the computation of cosine similarity\nbetween gradients of the clients and a temperature measure that detects when\nthe federated model starts to converge.

It creates a delicate interplay between\nuncertainty and confidence, distinguishing it from epistemic uncertainty that\ntypically diminishes with new information. Indeed, ambivalence can persist even\nafter additional knowledge is acquired. To address this phenomenon, we propose\na novel framework, called the epistemically ambivalent Markov decision process\n(EA-MDP), aiming to understand and control EA in decision-making processes.\nThis framework incorporates the concept of a quantum state from the quantum\nmechanics formalism, and its core is to assess the probability and reward of\nevery possible outcome.

Data\nsparsity remains a significant challenge in this area as most users have\nlimited interactions and many items receive little attention. To mitigate this\nissue, contrastive learning has been widely adopted. By constructing positive\nsample pairs from the data itself and maximizing their agreement in the\nembedding space,it can leverage available data more effectively. Constructing\nreasonable positive sample pairs is crucial for the success of contrastive\nlearning. However, current approaches struggle to generate reliable positive\npairs as they either rely on representations learned from inherently sparse\ncollaborative signals or use random perturbations which introduce significant\nuncertainty. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach named\nSemantic Retrieval Augmented Contrastive Learning (SRA-CL), which leverages\nsemantic information to improve the reliability of contrastive samples. SRA-CL\ncomprises two main components: (1) Cross-Sequence Contrastive Learning via User\nSemantic Retrieval, which utilizes large language models (LLMs) to understand\ndiverse user preferences and retrieve semantically similar users to form\nreliable positive samples through a learnable sample synthesis method; and (2)\nIntra-Sequence Contrastive Learning via Item Semantic Retrieval, which employs\nLLMs to comprehend items and retrieve similar items to perform semantic-based\nitem substitution, thereby creating semantically consistent augmented views for\ncontrastive learning.

However, existing architectures face a fundamental\ntrade-off between expressivity and efficiency, dictated by the structure of\ntheir state-transition matrices. While diagonal matrices used in architectures\nlike Mamba, GLA, or mLSTM yield fast runtime, they suffer from severely limited\nexpressivity. To address this, recent architectures such as (Gated) DeltaNet\nand RWKVv7 adopted a diagonal plus rank-1 structure, allowing simultaneous\ntoken-channel mixing, which overcomes some expressivity limitations with only a\nslight decrease in training efficiency. Building on the interpretation of\nDeltaNet's recurrence as performing one step of online gradient descent per\ntoken on an associative recall loss, we introduce DeltaProduct, which instead\ntakes multiple ($n_h$) steps per token. This naturally leads to diagonal plus\nrank-$n_h$ state-transition matrices, formed as products of $n_h$ generalized\nHouseholder transformations, providing a tunable mechanism to balance\nexpressivity and efficiency and a stable recurrence. Through extensive\nexperiments, we demonstrate that DeltaProduct achieves superior state-tracking\nand language modeling capabilities while exhibiting significantly improved\nlength extrapolation compared to DeltaNet.

However, selecting experts at the task\nlevel is often too coarse-grained, as heterogeneous tasks may require different\nexpertise for each instance. To enable adaptive instance-level mixing of\npre-trained LLM experts, we propose Symbolic-MoE, a symbolic, text-based, and\ngradient-free Mixture-of-Experts framework. Symbolic-MoE takes a fine-grained\napproach to selection by emphasizing skills, e.g., algebra in math or molecular\nbiology in biomedical reasoning. We propose a skill-based recruiting strategy\nthat dynamically selects the most relevant set of expert LLMs for diverse\nreasoning tasks based on their strengths. Each selected expert then generates\nits own reasoning, resulting in k outputs from k experts, which are then\nsynthesized into a final high-quality response by an aggregator chosen based on\nits ability to integrate diverse reasoning outputs. We show that Symbolic-MoE's\ninstance-level expert selection improves performance by a large margin but --\nwhen implemented naively -- can introduce a high computational overhead due to\nthe need for constant model loading and offloading. To address this, we\nimplement a batch inference strategy that groups instances based on their\nassigned experts, loading each model only once.

Through extensive evaluations on diverse\nbenchmarks (MMLU-Pro, GPQA, AIME, and MedMCQA), we demonstrate that\nSymbolic-MoE outperforms strong LLMs like GPT4o-mini, as well as multi-agent\napproaches, with an absolute average improvement of 8.15% over the best\nmulti-agent baseline.

This leads to two main issues: (1) a lack of memory\naccess (IO) reuse for KV cache of shared prefixes, and (2) poor load\nbalancing.As a result, there is redundant KV cache IO between GPU global memory\nand shared memory, along with low GPU utilization. To address these challenges,\nwe propose DeFT(Decoding with Flash Tree-Attention), a hardware-efficient\nattention algorithm with prefix-aware and load-balanced KV cache partitions.\nDeFT reduces the number of read/write operations of KV cache during attention\ncalculation through KV-Guided Grouping, a method that avoids repeatedly loading\nKV cache of shared prefixes in attention computation.

A recent groundbreaking work, direct preference optimization (DPO),\nhas greatly simplified the process from past work in reinforcement learning\nfrom human feedback (RLHF) by bypassing the reward learning stage in RLHF. DPO,\nafter training, provides an implicit reward model. In this work, we make a\nnovel observation that this implicit reward model can by itself be used in a\nbootstrapping fashion to further align the LLM. Our approach is to use the\nrewards from a current LLM to construct a preference dataset, which is then\nused in subsequent DPO rounds. We incorporate two refinements to further\nimprove our approach: 1) length-regularized reward shaping to make the\npreference dataset length-unbiased; 2) experience replay to enhance the quality\nof the preference dataset. Our approach, named self-alignment with DPO ImpliCit\nrEwards (DICE), shows great improvements in alignment. It achieves an increase\nof more than 8$\\\\%$ in lengthcontrolled win rate on AlpacaEval 2 for all the\ndifferent base models that we tried, without relying on external feedback.

However, these models\nincur exceptionally high computational costs. For instance, GPT-3 consists of\n175 billion parameters, where inference demands billions of floating-point\noperations. Caching is a natural solution to reduce LLM inference costs on\nrepeated queries, which constitute about 31% of the total queries. However,\nexisting caching methods are incapable of finding semantic similarities among\nLLM queries nor do they operate on contextual queries, leading to unacceptable\nfalse hit-and-miss rates. This paper introduces MeanCache, a user-centric\nsemantic cache for LLM-based services that identifies semantically similar\nqueries to determine cache hit or miss. Using MeanCache, the response to a\nuser's semantically similar query can be retrieved from a local cache rather\nthan re-querying the LLM, thus reducing costs, service provider load, and\nenvironmental impact. MeanCache leverages Federated Learning (FL) to\ncollaboratively train a query similarity model without violating user privacy.\nBy placing a local cache in each user's device and using FL, MeanCache reduces\nthe latency and costs and enhances model performance, resulting in lower false\nhit rates. MeanCache also encodes context chains for every cached query,\noffering a simple yet highly effective mechanism to discern contextual query\nresponses from standalone. Our experiments benchmarked against the\nstate-of-the-art caching method, reveal that MeanCache attains an approximately\n17% higher F-score and a 20% increase in precision during semantic cache\nhit-and-miss decisions while performing even better on contextual queries. It\nalso reduces the storage requirement by 83% and accelerates semantic cache\nhit-and-miss decisions by 11%.\n","authors":["Waris Gill","Mohamed Elidrisi","Pallavi Kalapatapu","Ammar Ahmed","Ali Anwar","Muhammad Ali Gulzar"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.02694v4.pdf","comment":"Accepted at 2025 IEEE 39th International Parallel and Distributed\n  Processing Symposium (IPDPS)"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00435v2","updated":"2025-03-07T14:33:10Z","published":"2025-03-01T10:24:42Z","title":"AILS-NTUA at SemEval-2025 Task 8: Language-to-Code prompting and Error\n  Fixing for Tabular Question Answering","summary":"  In this paper, we present our submission to SemEval-2025 Task 8: Question\nAnswering over Tabular Data.

Current research increasingly relies on large synthetic\ndatasets, automatically generated to cover tens of thousands of distinct entity\ntypes, to train zero-shot NER models. However, in this paper, we find that\nthese synthetic datasets often contain entity types that are semantically\nhighly similar to (or even the same as) those in standard evaluation\nbenchmarks. Because of this overlap, we argue that reported F1 scores for\nzero-shot NER overestimate the true capabilities of these approaches. Further,\nwe argue that current evaluation setups provide an incomplete picture of\nzero-shot abilities since they do not quantify the label shift (i.e., the\nsimilarity of labels) between training and evaluation datasets. To address\nthese issues, we propose Familiarity, a novel metric that captures both the\nsemantic similarity between entity types in training and evaluation, as well as\ntheir frequency in the training data, to provide an estimate of label shift. It\nallows researchers to contextualize reported zero-shot NER scores when using\ncustom synthetic training datasets.

While LLMs are primarily designed for natural language interaction, the\nextensive embedded knowledge empowers them to comprehend digital sensor data.\nThis capability enables LLMs to engage with the physical world through IoT\nsensors and actuators, performing a myriad of AIoT tasks. Consequently, this\nevolution triggers a paradigm shift in conventional AIoT application\ndevelopment, democratizing its accessibility to all by facilitating the design\nand development of AIoT applications via natural language. However, some\nlimitations need to be addressed to unlock the full potential of LLMs in AIoT\napplication development. First, existing solutions often require transferring\nraw sensor data to LLM servers, which raises privacy concerns, incurs high\nquery fees, and is limited by token size. Moreover, the reasoning processes of\nLLMs are opaque to users, making it difficult to verify the robustness and\ncorrectness of inference results.

Phi-4-Multimodal is a\nmultimodal model that integrates text, vision, and speech/audio input\nmodalities into a single model. Its novel modality extension approach leverages\nLoRA adapters and modality-specific routers to allow multiple inference modes\ncombining various modalities without interference. For example, it now ranks\nfirst in the OpenASR leaderboard to date, although the LoRA component of the\nspeech/audio modality has just 460 million parameters. Phi-4-Multimodal\nsupports scenarios involving (vision + language), (vision + speech), and\n(speech/audio) inputs, outperforming larger vision-language and speech-language\nmodels on a wide range of tasks. Additionally, we experiment to further train\nPhi-4-Mini to enhance its reasoning capabilities. Despite its compact\n3.8-billion-parameter size, this experimental version achieves reasoning\nperformance on par with or surpassing significantly larger models, including\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B.\n","authors":[" Microsoft"," :","Abdelrahman Abouelenin","Atabak Ashfaq","Adam Atkinson","Hany Awadalla","Nguyen Bach","Jianmin Bao","Alon Benhaim","Martin Cai","Vishrav Chaudhary","Congcong Chen","Dong Chen","Dongdong Chen","Junkun Chen","Weizhu Chen","Yen-Chun Chen","Yi-ling Chen","Qi Dai","Xiyang Dai","Ruchao Fan","Mei Gao","Min Gao","Amit Garg","Abhishek Goswami","Junheng Hao","Amr Hendy","Yuxuan Hu","Xin Jin","Mahmoud Khademi","Dongwoo Kim","Young Jin Kim","Gina Lee","Jinyu Li","Yunsheng Li","Chen Liang","Xihui Lin","Zeqi Lin","Mengchen Liu","Yang Liu","Gilsinia Lopez","Chong Luo","Piyush Madan","Vadim Mazalov","Arindam Mitra","Ali Mousavi","Anh Nguyen","Jing Pan","Daniel Perez-Becker","Jacob Platin","Thomas Portet","Kai Qiu","Bo Ren","Liliang Ren","Sambuddha Roy","Ning Shang","Yelong Shen","Saksham Singhal","Subhojit Som","Xia Song","Tetyana Sych","Praneetha Vaddamanu","Shuohang Wang","Yiming Wang","Zhenghao Wang","Haibin Wu","Haoran Xu","Weijian Xu","Yifan Yang","Ziyi Yang","Donghan Yu","Ishmam Zabir","Jianwen Zhang","Li Lyna Zhang","Yunan Zhang","Xiren Zhou"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.01743v2.pdf","comment":"39 pages"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13983v4","updated":"2025-03-07T09:02:42Z","published":"2025-01-23T06:57:24Z","title":"AdEval: Alignment-based Dynamic Evaluation to Mitigate Data\n  Contamination in Large Language Models","summary":"  As Large Language Models (LLMs) are pretrained on massive-scale corpora, the\nissue of data contamination has become increasingly severe, leading to\npotential overestimation of model performance during evaluation.

To this end, we\nintroduce a novel post-training and inference framework, called ARIES: Adaptive\nRefinement and Iterative Enhancement Structure.

However, the\nalignment objective used to train CLIP often results in subpar visual features\nfor fine-grained tasks. In contrast, SSL-pretrained models like DINO excel at\nextracting rich visual features due to their specialized training paradigm.\nYet, these SSL models require an additional supervised linear probing step,\nwhich relies on fully labeled data which is often expensive and difficult to\nobtain at scale. In this paper, we propose a label-free prompt-tuning method\nthat leverages the rich visual features of self-supervised learning models\n(DINO) and the broad textual knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to\nlargely enhance CLIP-based image classification performance using unlabeled\nimages.

This approach typically\nidentifies and adjusts specific model parameters associated with newly acquired\nknowledge. However, existing methods often underestimate the adverse effects\nthat parameter modifications can have on broadly distributed knowledge. More\ncritically, post-edit LLMs frequently struggle with multi-hop reasoning and\ncontinuous knowledge updates. Although various studies have discussed these\nshortcomings, there is a lack of comprehensive evaluation. In this paper, we\nprovide an evaluation of ten model editing methods along four dimensions:\nreliability, generalization, locality, and portability. Results confirm that\nall ten popular model editing methods show significant shortcomings across\nmultiple dimensions, suggesting model editing is less promising. We then\npropose a straightforward method called Selective Contextual Reasoning (SCR),\nfor knowledge updating. SCR does not modify model parameters but harnesses\nLLM's inherent contextual reasoning capabilities utilizing the updated\nknowledge pieces. Under SCR, an LLM first assesses whether an incoming query\nfalls within the scope of an external knowledge base.

Specifically, we\nintroduce code clustering methods that leverages LMs' capabilities in code\nunderstanding and reasoning, resulting in a set of metrics that represent the\nnumber of algorithms in model-generated solutions. We extensively investigate\nthe property of model-generated solutions by contrasting them with\nhuman-written ones and quantifying the impact of various factors on code\ndiversity: model size, temperature, instruction tuning, and problem complexity.\nOur analysis demonstrates that model-generated solutions exhibit low\nalgorithmic diversity, which was neglected by the research community. Moreover,\nwe explore methods to increase code diversity by combining solutions from\ndifferent models and increasing sampling temperatures. Our findings highlight\nthat code diversity can be enhanced with the help of heterogeneous models and\nsetting temperature beyond 1.0 that has not been fully explored due to the\nfunctional correctness degradation. To facilitate our research direction, we\npublicly share our code and datasets through open-source repositories.\n","authors":["Seonghyeon Lee","Heejae Chon","Joonwon Jang","Dongha Lee","Hwanjo Yu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.00691v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05157v1","updated":"2025-03-07T05:34:31Z","published":"2025-03-07T05:34:31Z","title":"Ensemble Debiasing Across Class and Sample Levels for Fairer Prompting\n  Accuracy","summary":"  Language models are strong few-shot learners and achieve good overall\naccuracy in text classification tasks, masking the fact that their results\nsuffer from great class accuracy imbalance.

To mitigate the prohibitive\ncosts associated with human evaluations, utilizing a powerful LLM as a judge\nhas emerged as a favored approach. Nevertheless, this methodology encounters\nseveral challenges, including substantial expenses, concerns regarding privacy\nand security, and reproducibility. In this paper, we propose a straightforward,\nreplicable, and accurate automated evaluation method by leveraging a\nlightweight LLM as the judge, named RocketEval. Initially, we identify that the\nperformance disparity between lightweight and powerful LLMs in evaluation tasks\nprimarily stems from their ability to conduct comprehensive analyses, which is\nnot easily enhanced through techniques such as chain-of-thought reasoning. By\nreframing the evaluation task as a multi-faceted Q&A using an instance-specific\nchecklist, we demonstrate that the limited judgment accuracy of lightweight\nLLMs is largely attributes to high uncertainty and positional bias. To address\nthese challenges, we introduce an automated evaluation process grounded in\nchecklist grading, which is designed to accommodate a variety of scenarios and\nquestions. This process encompasses the creation of checklists, the grading of\nthese checklists by lightweight LLMs, and the reweighting of checklist items to\nalign with the supervised annotations.

Recent\nstudies on detecting hallucinations in long text without external resources\nconduct consistency comparison among multiple sampled outputs.

Specifically, we present a specifically optimized multi-basis depth\ncompletion network, called BBC-Net, tailored to the characteristics of\ntraditional sparse SLAM systems. BBC-Net can predict multiple balanced bases\nand a confidence map from a monocular image with sparse points generated by\noff-the-shelf keypoint-based SLAM systems. The final depth is a linear\ncombination of predicted depth bases that can be optimized by tuning the\ncorresponding weights. To seamlessly incorporate the weights into traditional\nSLAM optimization and ensure efficiency and robustness, we design a set of\ndepth weight factors, which makes our network a versatile plug-in module,\nfacilitating easy integration into various existing sparse SLAM systems and\nsignificantly enhancing global depth consistency through bundle adjustment.

The SAV dataset consists\nof 4,324 carefully trimmed video clips from 758 different classrooms, annotated\nwith 15 distinct student actions. Compared to existing action detection\ndatasets, the SAV dataset stands out by providing a wide range of real\nclassroom scenarios, high-quality video data, and unique challenges, including\nsubtle movement differences, dense object engagement, significant scale\ndifferences, varied shooting angles, and visual occlusion. These complexities\nintroduce new opportunities and challenges to advance action detection methods.\nTo benchmark this, we propose a novel baseline method based on a visual\ntransformer, designed to enhance attention to key local details within small\nand dense object regions. Our method demonstrates excellent performance with a\nmean Average Precision (mAP) of 67.9% and 27.4% on the SAV and AVA datasets,\nrespectively. This paper not only provides the dataset but also calls for\nfurther research into AI-driven educational tools that may transform teaching\nmethodologies and learning outcomes.

Current MIL research primarily relies on embedding-based\napproaches, which extract patch features using a pre-trained feature extractor\nand aggregate them for slide-level prediction. Despite the critical role of\nfeature extraction, there is limited guidance on selecting optimal feature\nextractors to maximize WSI performance. This study addresses this gap by\nsystematically evaluating MIL feature extractors across three dimensions:\npre-training dataset, backbone model, and pre-training method. Extensive\nexperiments were conducted on two public WSI datasets (TCGA-NSCLC and\nCamelyon16) using four state-of-the-art (SOTA) MIL models. Our findings reveal\nthat: 1) selecting a robust self-supervised learning (SSL) method has a greater\nimpact on performance than relying solely on an in-domain pre-training dataset;\n2) prioritizing Transformer-based backbones with deeper architectures over\nCNN-based models; and 3) using larger, more diverse pre-training datasets\nsignificantly enhances classification outcomes.

In\na world where the people hired today become part of the hiring committee of\ntomorrow, we are particularly interested in understanding (and mitigating) how\naffinity bias affects this feedback loop. This problem has two distinctive\nfeatures: 1) we only observe the biased value of a candidate, but we want to\noptimize with respect to their real value 2) the bias towards a candidate with\na specific set of traits depends on the fraction of people in the hiring\ncommittee with the same set of traits.

However, selecting experts at the task\nlevel is often too coarse-grained, as heterogeneous tasks may require different\nexpertise for each instance. To enable adaptive instance-level mixing of\npre-trained LLM experts, we propose Symbolic-MoE, a symbolic, text-based, and\ngradient-free Mixture-of-Experts framework. Symbolic-MoE takes a fine-grained\napproach to selection by emphasizing skills, e.g., algebra in math or molecular\nbiology in biomedical reasoning. We propose a skill-based recruiting strategy\nthat dynamically selects the most relevant set of expert LLMs for diverse\nreasoning tasks based on their strengths. Each selected expert then generates\nits own reasoning, resulting in k outputs from k experts, which are then\nsynthesized into a final high-quality response by an aggregator chosen based on\nits ability to integrate diverse reasoning outputs. We show that Symbolic-MoE's\ninstance-level expert selection improves performance by a large margin but --\nwhen implemented naively -- can introduce a high computational overhead due to\nthe need for constant model loading and offloading. To address this, we\nimplement a batch inference strategy that groups instances based on their\nassigned experts, loading each model only once.

Through extensive evaluations on diverse\nbenchmarks (MMLU-Pro, GPQA, AIME, and MedMCQA), we demonstrate that\nSymbolic-MoE outperforms strong LLMs like GPT4o-mini, as well as multi-agent\napproaches, with an absolute average improvement of 8.15% over the best\nmulti-agent baseline.

Recent work\nhas established emergent ICL as a transient phenomenon that can sometimes\ndisappear after long training times. In this work, we sought a mechanistic\nunderstanding of these transient dynamics. Firstly, we find that, after the\ndisappearance of ICL, the asymptotic strategy is a remarkable hybrid between\nin-weights and in-context learning, which we term \"context-constrained\nin-weights learning\" (CIWL). CIWL is in competition with ICL, and eventually\nreplaces it as the dominant strategy of the model (thus leading to ICL\ntransience). However, we also find that the two competing strategies actually\nshare sub-circuits, which gives rise to cooperative dynamics as well. For\nexample, in our setup, ICL is unable to emerge quickly on its own, and can only\nbe enabled through the simultaneous slow development of asymptotic CIWL. CIWL\nthus both cooperates and competes with ICL, a phenomenon we term \"strategy\ncoopetition.\" We propose a minimal mathematical model that reproduces these key\ndynamics and interactions.

Sets of\nmembers and non-members, used to evaluate the MIA, are constructed using\ninformed guesses after the release of a model. This lack of randomization\nraises concerns of a distribution shift between members and non-members. In\nthis work, we first extensively review the literature on MIAs against LLMs and\nshow that, while most work focuses on sequence-level MIAs evaluated in post-hoc\nsetups, a range of target models, motivations and units of interest are\nconsidered. We then quantify distribution shifts present in 6 datasets used in\nthe literature using a model-less bag of word classifier and show that all\ndatasets constructed post-hoc suffer from strong distribution shifts.

This paper introduces MeanCache, a user-centric\nsemantic cache for LLM-based services that identifies semantically similar\nqueries to determine cache hit or miss. Using MeanCache, the response to a\nuser's semantically similar query can be retrieved from a local cache rather\nthan re-querying the LLM, thus reducing costs, service provider load, and\nenvironmental impact. MeanCache leverages Federated Learning (FL) to\ncollaboratively train a query similarity model without violating user privacy.\nBy placing a local cache in each user's device and using FL, MeanCache reduces\nthe latency and costs and enhances model performance, resulting in lower false\nhit rates.

While existing EFCIL methods\nleverage knowledge distillation to alleviate forgetting, they still face two\ncritical challenges: semantic shift and decision bias. Specifically, the\nembeddings of old tasks shift in the embedding space after learning new tasks,\nand the classifier becomes biased towards new tasks due to training solely with\nnew data, thereby hindering the balance between old and new knowledge. To\naddress these issues, we propose the Dual-Projection Shift Estimation and\nClassifier Reconstruction (DPCR) approach for EFCIL.

This reconstruction exploits previous information encoded in\ncovariance and prototype of each class after calibration with estimated shift,\nthereby reducing decision bias.

This study highlights the potential of physics-based\nmachine learning ($\\phi$ML) to predict the fatigue lifetime of materials.\nSpecifically, a FFNN is designed to embed physical constraints from\nexperimental evidence directly into its architecture to enhance prediction\naccuracy. It is trained using numerical simulations generated by a physically\nbased anisotropic continuum damage fatigue model. The model is calibrated and\nvalidated against experimental fatigue data of concrete cylinder specimens\ntested in uniaxial compression. The proposed approach demonstrates superior\naccuracy compared to purely data-driven neural networks, particularly in\nsituations with limited training data, achieving realistic predictions of\ndamage accumulation. Thus, a general algorithm is developed and successfully\napplied to predict fatigue lifetimes under complex loading scenarios with\nmultiple loading ranges.

The $\\phi$ML based algorithm\nis subsequently employed to investigate the influence of multiple loading\ntransitions on accumulated fatigue life, and its predictions align with trends\nobserved in recent experimental studies.

However, the\nalignment objective used to train CLIP often results in subpar visual features\nfor fine-grained tasks. In contrast, SSL-pretrained models like DINO excel at\nextracting rich visual features due to their specialized training paradigm.\nYet, these SSL models require an additional supervised linear probing step,\nwhich relies on fully labeled data which is often expensive and difficult to\nobtain at scale. In this paper, we propose a label-free prompt-tuning method\nthat leverages the rich visual features of self-supervised learning models\n(DINO) and the broad textual knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to\nlargely enhance CLIP-based image classification performance using unlabeled\nimages. Our approach unfolds in three key steps: (1) We generate robust textual\nfeature embeddings that more accurately represent object classes by leveraging\nclass-specific descriptions from LLMs, enabling more effective zero-shot\nclassification compared to CLIP's default name-specific prompts. (2) These\ntextual embeddings are then used to produce pseudo-labels to train an alignment\nmodule that integrates the complementary strengths of LLM description-based\ntextual embeddings & DINO's visual features.

Currently deployed in a live setting, our proposed\nframework substantiates its practical efficacy in achieving a balanced\noptimization that aligns with both user satisfaction and revenue goals.\n","authors":["Jungbae Park","Heonseok Jang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05227v1.pdf","comment":null}]}}
